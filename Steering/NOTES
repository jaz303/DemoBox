Behaviours left to implement:

  - obstacle avoidance
  
Other stuff:

  - understand the dot product
  - build a basis of a entity/component framework
    - construct gameobjects from factories
    - register gameobjects with relevant subsystems
    - ability to add gameobjects to word
    
Entity component:
  - an object that can be positioned in the game world
  - can be moveable or immoveable
  
  - every entity has:
    - position
    - mass
    - facing (angle)
    - velocity (vector)
    - max force
    - max speed
    
  facing needs to be separate from velocity!!!
