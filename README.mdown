Requirements
------------

You should have a working Flash/TextMate environment setup.

Creating a new project
----------------------

    ./create MyProject

This will create a new folder containing a skeleton class file (`MyProject.as`), links to the common libraries/components, and a TextMate project file (`MyProject.tmproj`).
